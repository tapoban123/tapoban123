### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am an intermediate-level programmer. 
I am quite experienced with Python Programming Language. 
I have created multiple GUI-based projects using _Tkinter_ and _sqlite_ in **Python**. 
I can also write advanced MYSQL queries. 
Currently I am learning Android App Development with Flutter and Firebase. I haven't uploaded any project on Flutter yet, but very soon I'll be posting some of the amazing android applications created by me in Flutter framework.
